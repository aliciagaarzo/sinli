# SINLI

## Introduction and purpose

This package is a libre-free implementation of the SINLI standard. It builds on top of email to communicate applications to manage all operations of the book sector in Spain.

There are 3 main roles in this sector:
- bookshops
- distributors
- editors

There are some other implementations of this standard, but all of those we know about are closed-source, sell for an expensive yearly license, and work only in Window$ Opressing System.

At [Devcontrol](https://framagit.org/devcontrol/) we are working for a project led by [Descontrol](https://descontrol.cat) to adapt the Odoo ERP (business managing software) to be used for both distributors and bookshops. In order to be a complete replacement of those closed-source apps, we are trying to make Odoo speak SINLI ;)
